## About Me

I am a multidisciplinary game developer with deep specialisation in systems programming and gameplay engineering.  
My academic background spans Electronic & Communication Systems as well as Civil Aviation & Management.  
I combine low-level technical understanding with high-level gameplay design to build systems that are both robust and reactive.

### Core Expertise

- Modular Weapon Systems & Ballistics Modeling  
  Scalable and extensible weapon logic, including fire mechanics, projectile handling, recoil simulation, and attachments.

- Character Architecture & State Machines  
  Movement frameworks, IK systems, animation state blending, and ability component integration.

- Mission Scripting & Gameplay Flow Control  
  Dynamic quest logic, conditional triggers, runtime narrative control, and objective state tracking.

- UI/UX Systems with Runtime Tooling  
  Runtime overlays, HUD frameworks, developer tools, and debug interfaces using ImGui, Slate, and custom widget logic.

- Networked Multiplayer Architecture  
  Replication logic, server-authoritative systems, latency handling, session lifecycle, and network prediction.

- Physics-Driven Vehicle Systems (Land/Air)  
  Vehicle simulation including suspension, drift, air control, and arcade/realistic physics toggles.

- Audio Systems Engineering  
  Developed custom audio managers, event-based SFX dispatchers, and music state controllers using C++. Designed responsive audio frameworks that react to gameplay, animation states, and world triggers.

- Full-Cycle Game Development  
  From low-level code to high-level content pipelines. Languages used: C, C++, C#, Python, Verse.

- Engine Specialization: Unreal Engine (UE4 / UE5)  
  Familiar with C++ API, Gameplay Ability System (GAS), Blueprints, animation graphs, and multiplayer architecture.

- In-Game Tools & Diagnostics  
  Systems for real-time entity scanning, world-space analyzers, targeting systems, developer HUDs, and internal debugging frameworks.
